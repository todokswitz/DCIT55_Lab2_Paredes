# Laboratory Exercise 2: MySQL Functions, Group By, Order By and Constraints

## Description:

This laboratory activity is meant to demonstrate the use of MySQL string, numeric, and date functions, as well as group by, order by, and constraints (specifically, the "NOT NULL" constraint in this case). In a more basic sense, it also demonstrates MySQL table creation, manipulation/alteration, and selection.
